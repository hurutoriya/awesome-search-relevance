# Tools

The "plungers" we use in our job day-to-day.

## Search Relevance Testing

- [Quepid](http://quepid.com) - test driven relevance browser sandbox using a small set of judgments
- [Splainer](http://splainer.io) - debug a single Solr or Elasticsearch query
- [Rated Ranking Evaluator](https://github.com/SeaseLtd/rated-ranking-evaluator) - Maven based relevance testing tool against a Solr or Elasticsearch config
- [Quaerite](https://github.com/mitre/quaerite) - Search relevance evaluation framework

## Search Engines

- [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch)
- [Vespa](http://vespa.ai)

## Learning to Rank Tooling

Tooling for doing machine learning to optimize relevance

### Search Engine Plugins

- [Elasticsearch Learning to Rank](http://github.com/o19s/elasticsearch-learning-to-rank) - supports storing and logging features (ES queries), uploading models, and executing Ranklib and XGBoost models
- [Solr Learning to Rank](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/learning-to-rank.html) - supports storing and logging features (Solr queries), uploading models, and executing a range of models

### Learning to Rank Training Models

- [Ranklib](https://sourceforge.net/p/lemur/wiki/RankLib/) - original implementation of LambdaMART and other algorithms
- [RankyMcRankFace](https://github.com/o19s/RankyMcRankFace) - Ranklib fork with a few extra features
- [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - eXtreme Gradient Boosting - scalably train a MART ranking model
- [LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM) - Microsoft's gradient boosting library
- [TFRanking](https://github.com/tensorflow/ranking) - Tensorflow ranking
